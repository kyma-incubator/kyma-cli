## Kyma-CLI as a Kubectl plugin

To follow this section a kubectl version of 1.12.0 or later is required.

A plugin is nothing more than a standalone executable file, whose name begins with kubectl- . To install a plugin, simply move this executable file to anywhere on your PATH.

Rename a `kyma` binary to `kubectl-kyma` and place it anywhere in your PATH:

```bash
sudo mv ./kyma /usr/local/bin/kubectl-kyma
```

Run `kubectl plugin list` command and you will see your plugin in the list of available plugins.

You may now invoke your plugin as a kubectl command:

```bash
$ kubectl kyma version
Kyma CLI version: v0.6.1
Kyma cluster version: 1.0.0
```

To know more about extending kubectl with plugins read [kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/extend-kubectl/kubectl-plugins/).
