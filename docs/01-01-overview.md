Kyma CLI is a command-line tool that supports Kyma developers. It provides a set of commands and flags you can use to: 

- Provision a cluster locally or on cloud providers, such as GCP or Azure, or use Gardener to set up and easily manage your clusters.
- Install, manage, and test Kyma.

The Kyma CLI is always released in parallel with Kyma to support the latest features, which also means that older Kyma versions can no longer be supported by the Kyma CLI.
Unless otherwise stated in the documentation of a specific Kyma CLI version, the Kyma CLI will always support the Kyma version it was released for and be backwards compatible with the two previous Kyma releases.
