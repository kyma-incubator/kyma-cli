1. Rename the `kyma` binary to `kubectl-kyma` and place it anywhere in your **{PATH}**:

```bash
sudo mv ./kyma /usr/local/bin/kubectl-kyma
```

2. Run `kubectl plugin list` command to see your plugin on the list of all available plugins.

3. Invoke your plugin as a kubectl command:

```bash
$ kubectl kyma version
Kyma CLI version: v0.6.1
Kyma cluster version: 1.0.0
```
