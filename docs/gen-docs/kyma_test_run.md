## kyma test run

Runs tests on a Kyma cluster.

### Synopsis

Use this command to run tests on a Kyma cluster.

Remarks: 
If you don't provide any specific test definitions, all available test definitions will be added to the newly created test suite.
To execute all test defintions, run `kyma test run -n example-test`.



```
kyma test run <test-definition-1> <test-defintion-2> ... <test-definition-N> [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --concurrency int   Specifies the number of tests to be executed in parallel. (default 1)
  -c, --count int         Defines how many times every test should be executed. ExecitionCount and MaxRetries flags are mutually exclusive. (default 1)
  -h, --help              Displays help for the command.
      --max-retries int   Defines how many times a given test is retried in case of its failure. A suite is marked as a Succeeded even if some test failed and then finally succeeded. The default value is 0, which means that there are no retries of a given test.
  -n, --name -n           Specifies the name of the new test suite. If you don't specify the value for the -n flag, the name of the test suite will be autogenerated.
```

  -v, --verbose             Displays details of actions triggered by the command.
