## kyma test run

Runs tests on a Kyma cluster.

### Synopsis

Use this command to run tests on a Kyma cluster.

Remarks: 
If you don't provide any specific test definitions, all available test definitions will be added to the newly created test suite.
To execute all test defintions, run `kyma test run -n example-test`.



```
kyma test run <test-definition-1> <test-defintion-2> ... <test-definition-N> [flags]
```

### Options

```
      --concurrency int    Specifies the number of tests to be executed in parallel. (default 1)
  -c, --count int          Defines how many times every test should be executed. "count" and "max-retries" flags are mutually exclusive. (default 1)
      --max-retries int    Defines how many times a given test is retried when it fails. A suite is marked with a "succeeded" status even if some tests failed at first and then finally succeeded. The default value of 0 means that there are no retries of a given test.
  -n, --name string        Specifies the name of the new test suite. If you don't specify the value for the "-n" flag, the name of the test suite will be autogenerated.
      --timeout duration   Maximum time during which the test suite is being watched, zero means infinite. Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "µs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
  -w, --watch --timeout    Watch the status of the test suite until it finishes or the defined --timeout occurs.
