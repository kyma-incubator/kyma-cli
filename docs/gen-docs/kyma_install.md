Installs Kyma on a running Kubernetes cluster.

## Synopsis

Use this command to install Kyma on a running Kubernetes cluster.

### Detailed description

Before you use the command, make sure your setup meets the following prerequisites:

* Kyma is not installed.
* Kubernetes cluster is available with your kubeconfig file already pointing to it.

Here are the installation steps:

The standard installation uses the minimal configuration. The system performs the following steps:

1. Deploys and configures the Kyma Installer. At this point, steps differ depending on the installation type.

   When you install Kyma locally **from release**, the system:
   
   1. Fetches the latest or specified release along with configuration.
   2. Deploys the Kyma Installer on the cluster.
   3. Applies downloaded or defined configuration.
   4. Applies overrides, if applicable.
   5. Sets the admin password.
   6. Patches the Minikube IP.
	
   When you install Kyma locally **from sources**, the system:

   1. Fetches the configuration yaml files from the local sources.
   2. Builds the Kyma Installer image.
   3. Deploys the Kyma Installer and applies the fetched configuration.
   4. Applies overrides, if applicable.
   5. Sets the admin password.
   6. Patches the Minikube IP.
    
2. Runs Kyma installation until the **installed** status confirms the successful installation. You can override the standard installation settings using the `--override` flag.



```bash

## Options inherited from parent commands

```bash
      --ci                  Enables the CI mode to run on CI/CD systems. It avoids any user interaction (such as no dialog prompts) and ensures that logs are formatted properly in log files (such as no spinners for CLI steps).
  -h, --help                Displays help for the command.
      --kubeconfig string   Specifies the path to the kubeconfig file. By default, Kyma CLI uses the KUBECONFIG environment variable or "/$HOME/.kube/config" if the variable is not set.
      --non-interactive     Enables the non-interactive shell mode.
  -v, --verbose             Displays details of actions triggered by the command.
